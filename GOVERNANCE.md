# Governance

## Overview

The Atento Core project follows a governance model inspired by SQLite, emphasizing long-term stability, quality, and clear ownership.

## Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)

The project is led by a BDFL who has final decision-making authority on all aspects of the project, including:

- Code acceptance and rejection
- Project direction and roadmap
- Release timing and versioning
- Governance changes

**Current BDFL:** Raul Rita (raul.rita)

## Core Team

A small core team of trusted contributors assists the BDFL with:

- Code review
- Bug triage
- Documentation
- Community support

Core team members are invited by the BDFL based on sustained, high-quality contributions.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must sign a CLA before their contributions can be accepted. This ensures:

- Clear intellectual property ownership
- The project can relicense if needed
- Long-term legal protection for the project

See [CLA.md](CLA.md) for details.

### 2. Code Review

- All code changes require review and approval from the BDFL or a designated core team member
- The BDFL has final say on all code decisions
- Quality and long-term maintainability take precedence over feature velocity

### 3. Communication

- GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- GitHub Discussions for questions and general discussion
- Pull requests for code contributions

## Decision Making

### Technical Decisions

The BDFL makes all final technical decisions, with input from:

- Core team members
- Community feedback
- Real-world usage patterns

### Non-Technical Decisions

The BDFL delegates day-to-day operational decisions to core team members but retains veto power.

## Conflict Resolution

In case of disagreements:

1. Discussion among involved parties
2. Core team input (if applicable)
3. BDFL makes final decision

## Changes to Governance

Only the BDFL can change this governance model.

## Philosophy

Like SQLite, Atento Core prioritizes:

- **Long-term stability** over rapid feature addition
- **Quality** over quantity
- **Simplicity** over complexity
- **Reliability** over performance (when trade-offs exist)
- **Small, focused codebase** over feature bloat

## Funding and Ownership

The project copyright is held by We are Progmatic. The project accepts:

- Individual contributions (via CLA)
- Sponsorships (without governance influence)
- Commercial support contracts (without governance influence)
